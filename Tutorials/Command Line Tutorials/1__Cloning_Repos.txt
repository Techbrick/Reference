Here's how to clone a repo (i.e. download a local copy):

1. Open the Git Shell. (On Windows, this is a shortcut on the desktop.  On Linux, open the terminal and navigate to your git folder.)

2. Type the following command, and then hit enter:
     git clone https://github.com:USERNAME/REPONAME.git
   where USERNAME is Techbrick and REPONAME is the name of the repo ("RecycleRush" for example).

This clones the repository onto your computer.  It will make a new directory for the repository, so you don't have to make one in advance.

sNow you can start editing the files! When you are done, and want to submit the changes, read Using_Cloned_Repos.txt
