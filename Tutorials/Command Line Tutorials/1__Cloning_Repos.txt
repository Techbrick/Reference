Follow these 2 steps to clone a repo (use for Test_Robot_Code, but not for MainWorkingCode):

1. Open the Git Shell. (On Windows, this is a shortcut on the desktop.  On Linux, open the terminal and navigate to your git folder.)
   Type the following code, and then hit enter:
        git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPONAME.git
   where USERNAME is Techbrick and REPONAME is Test_Robot_Code (in this case).

   This will clone the repository onto your computer - basically, it downloads a copy of the files onto your computer.


2. Next, type:
        cd REPONAME
   
   and press enter, where REPONAME is Test_Robot_Code again.

   This will change directories (cd), or open the folder where the Test_Robot_Code files are held.


Now you can start editing the files! When you are done, and want to submit the changes, read Using_Cloned_Repos.txt
