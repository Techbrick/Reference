Follow these 4 steps to fork a repository (use these steps for MainWorkingCode, but just clone Test_Robot_Code):

1. Navigate to the repo on github.com and click Fork in the right hand upper corner and select your own username.


2. Open the Git Shell (for Windows - in Linux just open the terminal) and type:
	git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPONAME.git
   and hit enter, where USERNAME and REPONAME are replaced by your username and the repository's name (MainWorkingCode in this case).

   This clones your fork of the repository down to your computer (gives you a copy of all of the files on your computer).


3. Next, type:
        cd REPONAME
    and hit enter, where REPONAME is replaced with MainWorkingCode again.

   cd changes directory, or basically opens the folder MainWorkingCode where the repos' files are stored.


4. Now, enter:
        git remote add upstream git@github.com:ORIGUSER/REPONAME.git
   and hit enter, where ORIGUSER is the user who's repository you forked and REPONAME is MainWorkingCode again.
   
   This tells git where you forked the repository from.
